## About

This repo aims to serve as a documentation of my various guitar-build projects. Any sections subheaded with `LX` represent a Learning Experience - or rather, how I recognise I did something wrong, and what I would try next time.

### Construction Grade Telecaster

![placeholderimage](https://via.placeholder.com/600x150/000000/FFFFFF/?text=Placeholder%20Image)

This project was inspired by a scrap piece of wood I found on my walk into work one morning. I know this isn't exactly an original idea, but I think my implementation may be somewhat unique - offering a distinct visual style with a cohesive and clear "construction" theme throughout the piece. This is my first guitar build, and you can find the relevant log [linked here](construction-grade-telecaster.md)
