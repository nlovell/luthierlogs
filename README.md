## About

This repo aims to serve as a documentation of my various guitar-build projects. Any sections subheaded with `LX` represent a Learning Experience - or rather, how I recognise I did something wrong, and what I would try next time.

## Guitar Builds

### Construction Grade Telecaster

**[Click here!](construction-grade-telecaster.md)**

This project was inspired by a scrap piece of wood I found on my walk into work one morning. I know this isn't exactly an original idea, but I think my implementation may be somewhat unique - offering a distinct visual style with a cohesive and clear "construction" theme throughout the piece. This is my first guitar build, and you can find the relevant log [here](construction-grade-telecaster.md).

## Other Builds

### Arduino Pickup Winder
